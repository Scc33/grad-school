# MP Notes

# MP 2 - EC2 and Load Balancer

- The load balancer listens on port 80 for HTTP
    - When the load balance receives something on port 80 it routes to the EC2 instances
    - We want to route to whatever port on the EC2 instance that the application is running on
    - For example, I had load balancer listening on port 80 which routed to port 5000 (where the application was running)
- EC2 instances still use memory even when they are stopped which costs
- Inbound rules have to be specified to allow any traffic

# MP 3 - AWS Lex & Lambda

- Writing to DymanoDB requires a crazy format but there is a serializer and deserializer
- Lex is for conversations
- Lambda handles the computation
- Cognito is for deployments

# MP 4 - Hadoop

- Think of map and reduce as very simple logic
- Its common to emit values like one because those will be summed up by the reducer
- Hadoop is very much a headspace to think in
- In python emitting is done by printing to stdin

# MP 5 - Spark

# MP 7 - HBase
