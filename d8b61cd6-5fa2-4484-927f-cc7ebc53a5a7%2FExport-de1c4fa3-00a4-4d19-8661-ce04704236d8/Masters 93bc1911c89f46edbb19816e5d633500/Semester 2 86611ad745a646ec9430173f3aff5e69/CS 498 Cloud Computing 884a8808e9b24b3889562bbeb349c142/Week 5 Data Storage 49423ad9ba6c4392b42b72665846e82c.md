# Week 5: Data Storage

## Cloud Storage Basics

- Data storage was one of the first use cases for cloud computing
- Fierce competition for data storage
- File system is the middleware between the physical storage and the programs running on top of the OS
    - Three layers: physical file system, virtual file system, logical file system
    - File system contains metadata
        - *inode* for each file or directory
        - inode table records where each node is located
        - Directories are special files listing the names and inode numbers of files under the folder
- Block storage
    - Internally to the physical hard drive the data is stored a sequence of file system blocks
- POSIX file system
    - Defines set of standards that the system should implement
    - Example standard: writes should be strongly consistent (Read after write should be consistent)

## Block Storage on the Cloud

### Cloud Block Storage Overview

- Block storage - instance storage
    - Physical machine running the virtual machine physically connected to the storage device
    - Data transfer speeds are limited by physical hardware speeds
    - Machine may be rented to someone else in the next minute so the data on the drive does not persist
        - Its ephemeral
        - Example: AWS instance store
- Cloud block storage
    - Simulate a hard drive or SSD
    - Physical machine running the VM is separate from the physical machine hosting the data
    - A single EC2 instance can be attached to more than one EBS
    - System can let you ‘burst’ bandwidth usage (use more than allotted)

### Amazon AWS EBS Storage

- Block level storage resembles traditional hard drive/SSD
    - Works more like a file system (remember s3 looks like a filesystem but its not actually a file system)
- AWS instance storage are ephemeral and connected to just one EC2 instance
    - Offer higher throughput and bandwidth because they are physically connected which makes them good for caching
    - Data is lost If underlying disk drive fails, instance stops, instance terminates
    - You can get reliability and persistence by using distributed file system (HDFS) or backing up to S3/EBS
- EBS volumes are highly available and reliable
    - Can be attached to running instances in same availability zone
    - Support encryption
    - Offers divergent types (SSD, HDD, cold storage)

## Object Storage on the Cloud

### Cloud Object Storage

- Distributed file systems are hard to implement
- CAP - consistency, availability, partition tolerance
- Transparency - invisible to client programs which “see” a system which is similar to a local file system
    - Behind the scenes distributed file system handles locating files, transporting data, and potentially providing other features
- What if we want to scale to “unlimited storage”
    - Solution: stop trying to have all 3 components of CAP
        - Availability - must have because otherwise customer data may be unavailable
        - Partition tolerance - networks do fail, cloud providers have to be resilient
        - Consistency - can be sacrificed
    - Typical BLOB storage can scale “infinitely” by being “eventually consistent”
    - Typically not POSIX compliant
    - Access model is using REST
- Relaxing consistency model distributed storage becomes much simpler, cheaper, very fast, available from outside of the cloud

### OpenStack SWIFT

- Binary large object - blob

- Checksums for each object
- Blobs can be spread out over partitions running on various nodes
- Use hash into ring to map objects into storage partitions

## File System in Cloud

### Cloud Managed File Systems

- NAS - network attached storage
- Clustered file system allows files to be accessed using same interfaces and semantics as local files
- Examples
    - NFS, SMB, Lustre (HPC), Ceph, Gluster
- Ideally parallel file system would hide the complexity of distributed storage and exhibit exact behavior of POSIX
- CAP

    - Consistency - every read receives the most recent write
    - Availability - every request receives a response
    - Partition tolerance - continues to operate despite messaged dropping or delayed
- You could roll your own distributed file system
    - Grab number of storage optimized VMs and install distributed file system
- Cloud-managed file system
    - AMazon FSx, AWS EFS, Azure Files, Google Cloud Filestore

### Amazon AWS Elastic File System

- Motivation - enterprise customers need a large distributed file system
    - S3 is large and distributed but it is an object storage without performance and eventual consistency model
    - Block storage (EBS, instance store) are small and mimic hard drives
    - Glacier good only for archival
- EFS provides fully NSFv4 compatible distributed filesystem
    - EFS is SSD backed, highly available/durable, grows and shrinks as needed

### Ceph: case study of a distributed file system

- Ceph is designed for performance, reliability, scalability, more general than HDFS
- MDS - meta data server
- ODS - object data server
- MON - monitor
- Decoupled data and metadata, dynamic distributed metadata management
- Decoupling data and metadata increases performance by limiting interactions between clients and servers

## Archive Storage, Backups, Storage Gateways, and Mass Data Transfer

### Cloud Archive Storage and Backup

- Availability of storage has direct impact on costs, if requests are very infrequent you can store in cloud storage
- Glacier/archive storage is very cheap but IO is expensive
- Cloud managed backups
    - Distributed backup is not a simple task

### AWS Glacier

- Take a tape, write to it, go store it in a safe like (like a mine lol)
- Typical access point to glacier is S3
- Typically takes 3 to 5 hours to prepare a download request
    - After that you have 24 hours to download from the staging location
- Because access is pretty expensive you basically only point data here you intend to never read ever again

### Storage Gateway and Mass Data Transfer

- Hybrid cloud
    - Some VMs on your infrastructure and some on public cloud need a way to connect to storage locations
    - Example —> on premise compute connect to storage in the cloud
- AWS sotorage gateway
    - File gateway, tape gateway (archival), volume gateway
- Once a company decides to move to the cloud there is a mass of data that needs to be transferred to the cloud
    - Copying over the network might not be cost effective or just not feasible
    - Solution - cloud provider sends you a physical device
    - Example AWS Snowball or Azure Data Box

## Internet Level Personal File Systems

- Object storage (S3), DropBox, Google Cloud, Box, Apple iCloud Drive
- Support syncing from a local machine to a limited number of owned devices
- Cloud providers use statistics to extract average access patterns to set pricing
- DropBox started by using Amazon S3 but moved to their own data centers in 2016 as their economics changed

# Quiz

- Which storage technology is the best for the following scenario?
    - "Application needs to update structured data frequently”
        - Ceph
        - Ceph is ideal when dealing with structured data, it has better performance and speed
    - "Store an operating system and application binaries remotely”
        - Swift
        - Swift is ideal when dealing with unstructured data like operating system's data and binaries
    - "An application that works with 80 GBs of images on in-house data center”
        - Swift
        - Swift is best when dealing with huge sizes of images
    - "An application that stores 200 GBs of binary data for a few minutes and doesn't need it to be persistent if the instance running it fails”
        - Instance store
        - Instance store provides storage solution that is terminates when the instance terminates or reboots.
    - "An application that archives 2,000 TB of data for a year”
        - Glacier
        - Glacier allows users to archive their data with very low cost in a very durable way.
    - "An application that stores and queries 2,000 TB of binary data for a few weeks”
        - AWS S3
        - AWS S3 is good for large volumn data storage in short time period.
    - "Application runs on a single node, needs to store 10GB of data for a few minutes”
        - Local hard disk or instance store
        - No need to use distributed file system.
    - Why do object stores such as AWS S3 cost lower than managed file systems such as AWS FSx Lustre?
        - Because of the relaxed consistency requirements of S3, building the distributed system to support it is much easier.
