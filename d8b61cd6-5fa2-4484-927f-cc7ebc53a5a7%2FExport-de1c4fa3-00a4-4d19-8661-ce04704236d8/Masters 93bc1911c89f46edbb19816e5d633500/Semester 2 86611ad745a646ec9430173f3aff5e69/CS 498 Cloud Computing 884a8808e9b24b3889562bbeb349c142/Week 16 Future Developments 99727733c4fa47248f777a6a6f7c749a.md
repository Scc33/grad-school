## Quiz

- It is likely that regulated industries will NOT be able to move to the cloud due to regulations such as the GDPR.
    - **False**
        - Regulations such as the European Union
        General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
        place restrictions on where customer data can
        be stored, Unique contracts with cloud storage providers, Privacy regulations, data retention, breaching
        response, and data ownership
- In coming years, it is likely that cloud computing will become more and more centralized in the USA, while cloud computing in other areas of the world will decline.
    - **False**
        - The cloud will become more global.
- In the context of this week's lectures, CAGR stands for
    - **Compound annual growth rate**
- According to Gartner, which of these is likely to grow the fastest over the next few years?
    - **IaaS**
- Gartner predicts that through 2022, at least what percentage of cloud security failures will be caused by organizations / end users?
    - **95%**
        - Gartner predicts that through 2022, at least 95% of cloud security
        failures will be caused by organizations / end users
- Since AI and automation are being applied more and more to the maintenance and management of clouds, it is forecasted that the employment of computer and IT occupations will fall over the next five years.
    - **False**
        - In fact, employment in this area is projected to grow faster than average
- Microsoft predicts that over the 2020-2025 timespan approximately what percent of new apps will be created with low-code / no-code tools?
    - **90%**
        - Microsoft predicts 500 million new apps in 2020-2025, 450 with low-code / no-code tools.
- According to Ted Malaska, it used to be that what locked you into a system was money, but now it is
    - **Code**
        - "It used to be buys in with money gets you locked in. What I feel today locks you in his code, and it's why even in our industry, they're still cobol." -- Ted Malaska
- In Ted Malaska's opinion, Spark & Flink should be categorized as
    - **databases**
        - "But the argument that I was making, it was Spark and Flink and Spark streaming, structured streaming and Flink should actually be in the database section, in the data storage section, not in the streaming section." -- Ted Malaska.
- In Ted Malaska's opinion, SQL is dying, and will eventually be replaced by NoSQL approaches.
    - **False**
        - Ted Malaska's opinion is that SQL will be around forever
