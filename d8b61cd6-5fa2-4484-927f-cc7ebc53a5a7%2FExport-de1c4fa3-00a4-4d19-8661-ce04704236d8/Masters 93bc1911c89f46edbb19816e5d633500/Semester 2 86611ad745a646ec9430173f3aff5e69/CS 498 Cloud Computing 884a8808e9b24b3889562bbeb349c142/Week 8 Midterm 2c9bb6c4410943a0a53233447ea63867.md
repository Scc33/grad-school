# Week 8: Midterm

# **Week 1: Introduction to Cloud Computing**

**Introduction:**

- What is cloud computing?
    - Cloud computing is running applications on other peoples hardware
- Why do we need cloud computing ?
    - Cloud computing allows to scale up and down resources, hand off technical complexity to experts, and reduce your capital expenditures
    - Faster iteration because no need to manage servers
- Delivery models of cloud computing:
    1. Software as a Service (SaaS)
        1. Providers the user applications of the network
    2. Platform as a Service (PaaS)
        1. Deploys customer created applications to the cloud
    3. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
        1. Runs and provides access to physical hardware

**Cloudnomics:**

- Utility pricing
    - Unit costs are higher than owning but can scale up and down
    - If the ratio of the utility premium (how much more expensive the cloud is) is less than ratio of peak to average demand then running in the cloud makes sense

- Value of common structure
    - Similar to multiplexing in networking
    - Cheaper to cram multiple applications into the same area
    - Higher utilization
    - Best case is negative correlation and positive correlation is worst case
- Measure and implications of smoothness
    
    ![Untitled](Week%208%20Midterm%202c9bb6c4410943a0a53233447ea63867/Untitled%201.png)
    
    - Fixed asset servicing highly variable jobs yields low utilization but multiplexing different jobs with different distributions can improve the smoothness and therefore utilization
- Cv in independant jobs and correlated jobs
    - More jobs will help with smoothness but not a lot because 1 over square root n

**Cloud services:**

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS):
    1. What is IaaS and why it is important to cloud computing?
        1. Enables all cloud services on top of it
        2. Cloud provider manages the infrastructure but you control O/S and up
    2. Advantages of IaaS?
        1. OpEx instead of CapEx, less complexity because no need to run datacenter, faster innovation
    3. Who are the main providers of IaaS?
        1. AWS, Azure, GCP, Oracle, IBM
- Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    1. What is PaaS?
        1. You control/build the applications and data and provider handles O/S and down
    2. Anatomy of a web service
        1. A frontend server drives the user experience and writes/reads to another more backend server with data
        
        ![Untitled](Week%201%20Cloud%20Computing%20Foundations%207cf0e13f862944378706c32492897d65/Untitled%205.png)
        
    3. Advantages of PaaS?
        1. Even less complexity and drives on focus on just building the application
        2. Can handle a lot of the required scaling
    4. Disadvantages of PaaS?
        1. Vendor lock in can make it difficult to switch to cheaper options
        2. Because of vendor lock in changing cloud providers is hard
        3. Can limit more than IaaS because you lack full control

    - Uses HTTP and XML to remotely invoke methods on other devices
    - SOA - reusable code, interaction, stability, reduce costs
    - Evolved as a successor to XML-RPC
- What is REST and what are its characteristics? Is REST a standard, a protocol or a set of best practices?
    - REST is a state of mind (and some best practices)
    - Happens over HTTP, usually uses JSON, used for CRUD (create, read, update, delete)
- Different data representations used
    - What is JSON? Why is it useful?
        - Key value store, used in REST
    - What is XML? Where is it used?
        - XML schema which maintains consistency in data transferred

# Serverless Computing

- What is serverless architecture?
    - You don’t manage any computers
    - PaaS or SaaS or FaaS can be thought of as serverless
        - PaaS unit of compute is the full app
        - FaaS unit of computing is a function
- What are examples of serverless compute? Serverless storage?

- What is Amazon S3 BLOB Storage? Why would you use this storage option?
    - BLOB - binary large object
    - S3 isn’t a full filesystem, great for storing lots of ‘working data’ (data you need access to but not blazing fast)
    - Replicating the data to multiple machines for availability
    - Weak consistency
        - Once an object is deleted, it may take some time before all of the replicated copies of the object are deleted. Other processes may still read those replicated copies before they are all deleted

    - Query - operation where index is used to retrieve item in Log(n) time
    - Scan - reads every record and tests for a condition because no index available
- DynamoDB usage model: Put and Get
    - Get - retrieve an item
    - Put - add item to table
- DynamoDB Primary key, sort key
    - Primary key - used to distribute key values in different partitions
    - Sort key - used to keep items in partition sorted
        - Useful for scan and query
- DynamoDB Secondary index
    - Secondary index - similar to main index requires partition key and sort key
        - LSI - immediately consisted, and once created the table cannot grow anymore
        - GSI - eventual consistency model and does not constrain table size

    - Swift is BLOB store so many used for unstructured binary data
        - Swift is ideal when dealing with unstructured data like operating system's data and binaries

Amazon AWS EBS storage

- EBS are physically separate but very fast, can be backed up, dispatched and encrypted
- Even though AWS Instance Stores can handle higher throughput because they are located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer, experiments show that their edge over EBS in throughput tests is not orders of magnitude, a testament to the efficiency of NVM over Fiber technologies and data center networking designs.

Amazon AWS Instance store

- well-suited for temporary logs, well-suited for caching, located on disks physically attached to the host computer
- EC2 instances come with instance store (think instance gets an instance)

Amazon AWS EFS

- Why is Dropbox an especially good example of an internet-level personal file system?
    - DropBox, OneDrive, Apple iCloud Drive
    - This market segment does not accept access pattern limits, so cloud providers use statistics to extract average access patterns and set pricing. On average, they make a profit but may lose money on some users with high access patterns.

Clustered file systems
