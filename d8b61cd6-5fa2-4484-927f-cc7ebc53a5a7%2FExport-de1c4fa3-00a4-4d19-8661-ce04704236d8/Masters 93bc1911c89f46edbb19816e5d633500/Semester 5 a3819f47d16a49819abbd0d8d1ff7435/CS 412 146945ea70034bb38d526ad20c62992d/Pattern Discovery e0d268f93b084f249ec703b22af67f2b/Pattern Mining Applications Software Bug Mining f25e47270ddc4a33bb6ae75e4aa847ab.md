# Pattern Mining Applications: Software Bug Mining

## Pattern Discovery for Software Bug Mining

- Finding bugs is challenging
    - Often no clear spec
    - Often very complex
    - Often runtime data is larger and complex
- Software reliability analysis
    - Static bug detection
    - Dynamic bug detection (run the code)
    - Debugging (given symptoms pinpoint the bug location in the code)
- Why pattern mining?
    - Mining patterns can narrow the scope of inspection
