# Week 10/11/12 - Data Cleaning Project

## Quiz

- Which of the following shortcomings of rule-based systems used for data cleaning may be avoided with ML?
    - The number of rules may explode rapidly, making them unmanageable.
    - Ensuring rule consistency for real data cleaning scenarios can be hard at scale.
- How might future research in data cleaning help address problems in ML?
    - To detect and repair multi-modal data errors
    - address privacy concerns
- What actions can be taken when duplicate records are detected
    - Duplicate records are merged into new records that avoid duplication.
- What properties of the C5.0 algorithm make it appropriate for unique dataset classification tasks?
    - The decisions made by C5.0 are interpretable by humans.
    - The training time required by C5.0 is short.
- Which problems do data cleaning methods for ML exhibit?
    - Lack of generalizability
    - Tradeoff between computational cost and dataset coverage
- Which features describe HoloClean as a data cleaning framework to improve ML tasks
    - **It uses marginal probabilities to decide which candidate sample to clean.**
    - **Clean and dirty samples are needed during the training phase.**
- Which framework features were considered to create KAER?
    - Testing the effectiveness of knowledge injection and prompting methods on entity resolution tasks.
    - Inferring column types to provide signals to pre-trained language models.
- What are some consequences of knowledge augmentation on entity resolution for data cleaning?
    - The methods perform better on smaller datasets.
