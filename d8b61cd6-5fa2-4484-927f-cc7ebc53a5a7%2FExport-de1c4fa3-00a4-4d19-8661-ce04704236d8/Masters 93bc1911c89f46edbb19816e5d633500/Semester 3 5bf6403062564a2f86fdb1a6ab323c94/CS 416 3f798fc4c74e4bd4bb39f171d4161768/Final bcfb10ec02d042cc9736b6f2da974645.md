    - SVG
        - Embedded in HTML using <svg> tag
        - SVG tag needs widget and height (px or %)
        - Origin (0,0) is upper left corner
        - Position items using tag attributes or group nodes (<g>)
    - D3
        - JS library designed to work alongside DOM and SVG
        - Associates HTML elements with data and treats object hierarchy as a database
        - .data —> binds an array of data to array of elements
        - .selectAll() → returns database query of HTML document
        - datum —> individual data array value o each mark (HTML element) in chart
        - D3 methods can be chained
        - Functions are objects and can be passed as parameters (first class functions/functional programming)
        - Relational algebra
            - Exit - antijoin
            - Update - natural join
            - Enter - antijoin

- Interactive computing
    - User speaks in clicks, drags, and key presses
    - Computer hears events that trigger functions
    - Computer speaks in display objects
    - User hears information and reacts
    - Task analysis - study way a person best completes a task
        - Decompose task into user steps
        - Results in basic actions that may be shared
    - Dialog design - determine how user and computer will interact
        - Choose display elements
        - Choose UI widgets
        - Connection actions to widgets
- MVC
    - Model - application class
        - Example - web server
    - View - formats & display info
        - Example - display and drivers/CSS
    - Controller - initiates model and view actions
        - Example - Computer
- JavaScript execution
    - Event driven JavaScript - event processing loop calls event handler for next event in the queue
        - Browser adds events to the queue as they occur
    - Single-threaded javascript can stall
    - Promises will run resolve or reject after they complete
        - Can await a promise which won't stall the event loop
- Tooltip
    - Task analysis - what information will the viewer need to see the tooltip?
    - Dialog design - how does the viewer know that the tooltip is available
    - Affordance - hints in the appearance of an object that imply object's function
- Transitions - provides visual continuity when changing data values or visualization methods
- D3 Graph layout
    - Electrostatic prevents overlaps
    - Edge length specified by distance method
    - Edges are represented by the node-to-node physical simulation
- Elements of visual structure
    - Structure - Helping a user navigate a scene
    - Highlight - directing a user's attention scene
    - Transition - Keeping user oriented between scenes
        - Goal is to keep the viewer from becoming disoriented
        - Transitions help users retain a sense of context as data or charts change from scene to scene in a narrative visualization.
    - Ordering
        - Linear - one author led path
        - User-directed - user selects one of paths designed by the author
        - Random-access - user selects any path, no guidance by author
    - Interactivity
        - Number of ways the user can manipulate the data
        - How the user learns to manipulate
    - Messaging
        - How are observations and commentary communicated or learned
- Visual ordering genres
    - Types
        - Video
            - Video provides very little opportunity for reader-driven re-ordering of the content, just play, pause, and rewind.
        - Magazine
        - comic strip
        - flow chart
            - Elements usually connected by arrows to stability a well-defined ordering of elements
        - slide show
        - partitioned poster
            - Creates a structure allowing for viewer to work through frames in order
        - annotated chart
    - What is the primary goal of visual structure?
        - To help the viewer navigate the scene.
- Narrative visualization spectrum
    - For the project we had to build something following the hybrid structure
    - Martini glass - starts with observations from author, ends with reader driven content
        - A slide show followed by free-form exploration.
        - The slide show is author-led content, corresponding to the stem, that leads to a more free-form exploration, which corresponds to the widening bowl.
    - Interactive slideshow - slide show that has annotations and user can interact
        - A slide show with the ability to drill down into the details in each slide.
        - An interactive slide show consists of a main author-led pathway, but allows the viewer to explore some side paths that can drill down into details in a slide, though these side paths are often also author-led.
    - Drill-down story - one story but user can go off on tangents if they want to
        - A single scene with the ability to initiate a slide show from select points in the scene.
        - These slide shows provide the ability to drill down into the details of the narrative visualization.

    - Narrative visualization model
        - Scene - scenes are analogous to slides in a presentation (should be a single chart or coordinated set)
        - Annotations - used for messages and should follow a template
        - Parameters - Variables in a chart and other scene elements
        - Triggers - Connections between parameters
- Grammar of graphics
    - GoG design tree

    - Components
        - Data - (<variable name> = <data source>)*
        - Trans - <data transformation>*
        - Frame - <var> <op> <var> (<op> <var>)
        - Coord - <coordinate system>*
        - Scale - <coordinate transformation>*
        - Graph - point, line, area, bar, etc
        - Guide - <guides>*
- Programming types
    - Imperative programming
        - Sequence of commands
        - Each command changes the system state
    - Declarative programming
        - Specification of desired system
            - Ex: Using a sum method for the array
                - This is declarative because we are telling the computer what we want (the sum) and not how to compute it.
        - HTML + CSS
        - HTML events are declarative

    - Vega
        - Declarative programming language
        - Vega runtime uses the Vega specification
            
            ![Screenshot 2023-07-31 at 5.30.47 PM.png](Final%20bcfb10ec02d042cc9736b6f2da974645/Screenshot_2023-07-31_at_5.30.47_PM.png)
            
        - Reactive programming
            - Values change only in response to discrete events
                - Reactive programming is programming in response to events, such that everything is implemented as a callback responding to an event, though the events are not always user initiated, and can include clock ticks or “onload.”
            - Event-driven functionally reactive programming (E-FRP)
            - Values change only in response to discrete events and events are processed as streams
            - Uses a grammar to specify interactivity
            - Stream - sequence of events of a type
            - Signal - response triggered by an event in a stream
                - Supports Parameters and triggers
                    - Signals are variables and so are the parameters of a narrative visualization. These signal variables change their value due to events, which matches the definition of a trigger for narrative visualization.
            - Gives a way of describing user interactions
            - Grammars
                - Event catenation
                    - mousedown, mouseup
                    - A single stream that merges mousedown and mouseup streams
                - Event prefiltering
                    - [mousedown, mouseup] > mousemove
                    - [a,b] > c creates a stream of c events but only the ones that occur between a and b events
                    - [click, click] > mousemove
                        - A click, a mousemove, and another click (the > symbol indicates prefiltering of the mousemove events and they have to happen between the bracketed events
                - Time interval filtering
                    - mousemove{3ms,5ms}
                    - Selects only mousemove events between 3ms and 5ms apart
        - Vega-lite
            - Simplifies Vega's declarative specification by automating many specific choices (limits flexibility)
            - Expands Vega's declarative approach of JSON specification into a grammar-based approach
            - “Backing points” - compact description of user selected data items
                - The backing points are used to describe user selected data items. They are compact, so that if a range of data items are selected, the backing points can just be the first and last data items of the selected range.
        - Domain specific languages
            - Vega, vega-lite, ellipsis
            - JS is a vernal purpose programming language
        - Ellipsis
            - Language of narrative visualization
            - Embedded in JS as an APPI
            - Declarative with domain specific language
            - Includes a WYSIWYG
