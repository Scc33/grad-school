# Week 9 - Narrative Visualization

### Narrative Structure

- Elements of the visual narrative
    - Structure - helping a user navigate a scene
    - Highlight - directing a user's attention in a scene
    - Transition - keeping user oriented between scenes
- Elements of narrative structure
    - Ordering
        - Linear - one author-led path
        - User directed - user selects one of paths designed by the author
        - Random-access - user selects any path with no guidance by author
    - Interactivity
        - Number of ways the user can manipulate visualization
        - How the user learns to manipulated the visualization
    - Messaging - how are observations and commentary communicated or learned?
- Narrative layouts (Visual ordering genres)
    - Video
    - Magazine
    - Comic strip
    - Flow chart
    - Slide show
    - Partitioned poster
    - Annotated chart

### Creating a Narrative Visualization

- Model for narrative visualization
    - Scenes, annotations, parameters, triggers
        - Its like a state machine
    - Scenes - analogous to slides in a presentation
        - Each scene is a single chart or coordinated set of charts
        - Should follow a templated
    - Annotations - used for messaging
        - Use a template to support visual consistency
        - Annotations are usually cleared but can remain to build to a conclusion
    - Parameters - variables in a chart and other scene elements
    - Triggers - connections between parameters
- Tableau stories
    - In Tableau a story is a narrative visualization
