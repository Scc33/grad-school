    - Quantitative - sum, mean, median, minimum, maximum
    - Count - converts ordinal or nominal data into quantitative data
    - Binning - discretizes quantitative data into ordinal or nominal data
- Polaris
    - About improving UI into the data
    - Built on pivot tables and user selected rows/columns
        - When pivoting 3 fields you replace each record with 3 records in the new field
    - Generalized pivot tables to a variety of plots beyond tables
- VizQL
    - Evolved from Polaris
    - Unified framework for chart design and database query
    - Designed for interactivity (declarative/complied language)
- Table algebra
    - Grammar of graphics
        - Fields are qualitative (Q) or ordinal
        - Axes:
            - Q —> Plotting axis
            - O —> table axis
        - Can be concatenated

        - Cross product-ed

        - Nested
            - Cross product where both corresponding records exist

    - Visual —> query
        1. Select records passing the current filter
            1. Select * Where <filters>
        2. Partition records into table algebra panes (pane is the intersection of row and column axis elements)
            1. Select * Where (Row(i) And Column(j))
        3. Aggregate the records
            1. Select <dimensions>, <aggregates> Having <aggregate filters> Order By <sorting function>

### Week 2

- Fitts law
    - Larger movements are faster but less accurate than smaller ones
    - T = 600ms + 240 ms lg (1 + D / S) where D=distance to target and s=size of target
- Memory
    - Working memory (human DRAM) - 70ms access time, 200ms refresh time, size roughly 7
    - Long term memory - episodic (events, organized temporally), semantic (facts, organized associatively)
- Reasoning
    - Deductive reasoning - logic (whenever you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains must be the truth)
    - Inductive reasoning - if true for x then true for x+1 (infer missing data or extrapolate)
    - Abductive reason - human need for meaning and asking why
- Chromatic aberration - never use pure blue because it doesn't focus in the lens of the eye correctly
    - Tend to focus better on warmer colors
- L = 31%R + 59%G +10%B so green appears to be the brightest
- Rods = brightness and cones = color
    - More cones in center of vision but more rods in peripheral vision
- Lateral inhibition - eyes real-time edge and motion detector
    - Leads to lots of visual tricks like phantom black dots or slanted lines

- Our perception of size is influenced by distance to the object
- Vector graphics - uses a vertices/strokes/fills to draw solid/gradient/texture
- Raster graphics - arbitrary fills with pixels
- 3d pipeline: vertex processing —> rasterization —> pixel processing
- Visual perception
    - Occlusion - implies near to far
    - Illumination - cues orientation of a surface
    - Shadows - cues relative position
    - Perspective - reveals different scales and adds depth perception (small = farther away)
    - Stereopsis - render from two different viewpoints

### Week 3

- Data layer —> mapping layer —> graphics layer
    - Data layer is sources and collection
    - Mapping associates data with geometry (also analysis)
    - Graphics layer turns geometry in visuals

    - Bar chart —> quantitative Y and discrete/nominal independent
    - Line chart —> quantitative/continuous X and Y
    - Scatter plot - quantitative X and Y
    - Table - discrete/nominal independent

    - Cartogram - scaling the world by population type graphs
    - Choropleth - coloring the world by some variable
    - Saccades - eye scans forward and we don't perceive it (feels fluid to the human)
- PCA
    - Used to reduce the dimensionality and comes from the eigenvectors
- MDS - multidimensional scaling
    - Dimensionality reduction project from high dimensional space that tries to preserve distances
- Social network
    - Many low degree nodes and fewer high degree nodes
    - Also called logarithmic or scale-free graphs
- Graph embedding
    - Create laplacian where 1 / deg(i) if there is edge between I and j
    - Zero out the ones you want to fix the position of
- GEM force directed layout
    -
