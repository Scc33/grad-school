# Week 1 - Intro

## What is data science?

- Definitions
    - “Work concerned with collection, preparation, analysis, visualization, management, and preservation of large collections of information”
    - Data science is concerned with all aspects of the creation, management, analysis, and communication of data
    - Objective: *extracting useful knowledge from data*
- Data science = data curation + data analytics
    - Curation - ensuring that data can be efficiently and reliably found and used
        - Values - should be efficient and reliable, findable
    - Analytics - implying specific techniques to extract knowledge from data
        - Values - extraction should be novel, fast, precise, and accurate

## What is data curation?

- Science of data curation - research and development on new methods of data management; draws on math. engineering, social science, law, etc methods
- Practice of data curation - use and adoption of data management methods to meet user needs and support data analytics
- Most of cost associated with using data is associated with curation

## Objectives, Activities, Methods

- Areas of activities
    - Collection - support for collection and acquisition of data
    - Organization - employ an appropriate data model and use appropriate standards
    - Preservation - ensure data will be understandable and useable in the future
    - Discoverability - support ability to search for and locate relevant data
    - Access - support the ability to retrieve and distribute data
    - Workflow - support the ability to systematize data work flows
    - Identification - Support the ability to identify, authenticate, and validate data
    - Integration - Support integration of data from different sources using different data models
    - Reformatting - Support reformatting for use by different tools or to match new format standards
    - Reproducibility - Support ability to reproduce results to ensure scientific validity
    - Sharing - Support sharing data between researchers, teams, and institutions
    - Communication - Support representation, publishing, and visualizations that provide insight
    - Provenance - Support identifying what inputs, processes, and calculations are responsible for data values
    - Modification - support management of corrections and updates
    - Compliance - ensure compliance to legal, regulatory, and local policy requirements
    - Security - ensure that data is secure from tampering or inappropriate access
- Methods of curatorial actions
    - Analysis - determine needs and develop relevant data models and metadata and reformat, correct, or update data
    - Documentation - to record essential information
    - System design and implementation - to support all data curatorial activities
    - Policy - to specify objectives, procedures, practices, and formats
    - Process - to ensure success by managing the development of organizational units and roles, providing training

## Quiz

- Data science can be divided into two parts
    - **Data curation and data analytics**
- What of the following best describe differences between data curation and data analytics
    - **Data analytics is concerned with efficient and accurate knowledge extraction while data curation is concerned with ensuring the data used are reliable, findable and useable.**
    - **Data analytics focuses on extracting knowledge from data while data curation focusing on managing data to support data analytics.**
- Our definition of data science
    - Management
    - communication
    - Creation
    - Analysis
- One of the conclusions of the NAS reports on workforce preparation
    - **Domain-specific knowledge**
    - **Librarianship and archival practice**
    - **Computer and information science**
- Active and archival. Stonebraker et all (2013) define data curation as including discover of data, cleaning and transformation, semantic integration, and deduplication. In this paper which perspectives do they focus on
    - **Active curation**
- Grey et al (2002) make which of the following arguments about curation of data
    - **During a project, data are best managed by the project team. However, in the long term data should reside in a long-term science archive.**
        - They argue that during a project, the science team has the most knowledge of the data but archiving requires a separate set of skills.
    - **Documentation, procedures, software, and operations logs should be part of a data publication.**
        - They emphasize that this additional information (which they call "metadata") is essential to understanding the data.
- Which of the following statements do Buneman et al (2008) make about curated databases
    - **The creation of curated databases requires significant effort and expertise.**
    - **Provenance information can be used to track the source of information in a curated database.**
    - **Since the information in curated databases is often updated, it is important to be able to cite and retrieve specific versions.**
- Data collections universe in NSB report on long-lived digital data collections
    - **Digital data and data collections**
    - **Data authors, managers, users, and scientists**
    - **Software, hardware and communications infrastructure**
        - Software, hardware and communications infrastructure play an essential role in data production, use, and communication.
- Data organization
    - **Documenting and maintaining metadata about schema changes.**
        - As an organization strategy or schema evolves, it is important to maintain documentation about changes.
    - **Identifying and applying relevant standards for syntax and semantics.**
    - **Selecting an appropriate data model and schema.**
- Which curatorial activity is primarily concerned with identifying the inputs, calculations, and other actions responsible for data values?
    - Provenance
