# Week 4 - Ontologies

### Connecting Data to Information

- The problem - connecting data to information
    - Tables and trees abstract away from storage and processing but many ways to store the same data and many ways to use tables and trees to express the same information
    - Where is the understanding of the domain? — often just in the memory of programmers and staff
- We need an independent neutral way to describe the domain of interest
    - It must abstract away logical models and schema variations
    - Needs to precise, complete, and mathematical
    - Must map descriptions to schema
    - We use many inferences to usually understand data but that simply isn't that precise (for example using English meanings of column headings and values)
- We lake a framework that maps features in the domain of interest to the tree schemas
    - Could provide semantics for the schemas
    - We need another level of abstraction to formalize all of this

### Ontologies

- Ontologies provide a way to abstract away from data structures and focus on information
    - “Conceptualize your domain of interest in term of things and relationships and then map that conception to whatever logical models are being used”
- ER model has foundation in first order logic (FOL)

    - We now have a description of the structure of the domain (conceptual schema)
    - Conceptual schemas provide documentation of the dataset
- Where does the mapping occur?
    - Step by step generation of relational schemas from an ER schema
    - If relational schema was generated mechanical from ER schema then that ER schema reliably documents relationship between domain and relational schema
- Simple dyadic predication - RDF triple

- What is an ontology?
    - An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization of a domain
        - A body of formally represented knowledge is based on a conceptualization
        - A conceptualization is an abstract, simplified view of the world that we wish to present for some purpose
        - Conceptual models vs ontologies
            - Class relationships in ontologies

- Tree model of XML and semi-structured nature of XML makes it challenging to develop a model for it

### ER/Ontology Example: FRBR

- FRBR is used for library cataloguing
    - What is a book? Did you read the same book I did?
        - Same novel? but different language
        - Same text? but the large type edition
        - Same edition? but the summer one
        - Same copy?
        - Lots of questions spawn from just one question
    - FRBR - functional requirements for bibliographic records
        - FRBR replaces books with four kinds of entities
            - The work - a distinct work
            - The expression
            - The manifestation
            - The item -  a single exemplar of a manifestation

- ER modeling
    - Isolate the kinds (types) objects (entities) that are of interest
    - Once high level structure of the model has been charted…
        - Identify relationships between the entities
        - Identify attributes and values

### Implementing Ontologies in RDF/RDFS

- RDF - resource description framework
    - Simple model for predication
    - Gives a general model for describing things
        - Can be expressed as a graph or serialized
    - Basic structure is a triple (an ordered set of three elements)
        - Subject (thing)
        - Predicate (property)
        - Object (value)

    - RDF is not consistent with FRBR so we need a schema…
- RDFS - RDF schema
    - Basic schema concepts for defining RDF instances
    - Uses RDF triples as its syntax

- OWL - web ontology language
    - General schema concepts for more advanced schemas

### Quiz

- Both the relational and XML models lack
    - **the ability to specify real-world semantics**
- Describe the relationships between schemas and ontologies
    - **A schema defines the structure and organization of data while an ontology defines the semantics and relationships of concepts within a domain.**
- The logical basis for the ER model is important because
    - **it provides a specification of real world things, attributes, and relationships in a domain that can be used to give a logical schema meaning.**
- According to the “data model relationships” described in the lectures, at the conceptual level RDFS and OWL apply to which of the following logical models
    - Triples
- Chen makes which of the following points about the proposed entity-relationship model?
    - The entity-relationship model can be used to provide a unified view of data independent of the underlying model.
- Mapping between formal ontologies and logical schemas provides which of the following
    - Because the schemas now have semantics, instances have meaning and assert propositions.
    - A shared ontology can be used to identify common domain features across different schemas.
    - Mapping schemas to ontologies provides essential documentation.
    - **All of the above**
- If Codd encouraged abstraction away from storage methods to the data itself then Chen encourages us to
    - **abstract away from specific data models (e.g., tables, trees) to the information itself, the entities and relationships of the domain**
- Which of the following is **not** true about the RDF model as described in Decker, Mitra, Melnik (2000)
    - **In the RDF specification, the data model and syntax are both defined in XML.**
- In their overview of ontology engineer, Kendall and McGuinness state which of the following ontologies
    - The primary reason for creating an ontology is to make the meaning of terms, concepts, and relationships explicit for both humans and computers.
- Ensuring data quality is an essential part of data curation. In their discussion of RDF data quality and validation… Gayo state…
    - **Shape-based schema languages can be used to define a set of constraints to be applied to nodes in an RDF graph.**
    - **Given the same ontology and instance data, different applications require distinct validation constraints.**
- GO… which is **not**  part of the Gene Ontology Consortiums process
    - E. The GO uses a SHACL schema for validation
