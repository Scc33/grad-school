# Week 2 - Relations

### Data Models

- Examples
    - Relations (like databases)
        - Well-suited for data that has attribute/value pairs
    - Entity/Relationships (ontologies)
        - ER represent things and relationships of a domain
    - Trees
        - Well suited for hierarchical structured data
        - Can be used to serialize relationships
- What is a data model?
    1. A **type** of framework
    2. A **particular** framework (schema)
    3. An **application** of a particular framework
    - Three components
        - Structure
        - Things
        - Contraints
        - Often specification of operations is considered essential
- Data models to data curation. Curation requires
    - Select data model types
    - Select data model schemas
    - Develop dat model schemas
    - Revise data model schemas
    - Revise data model schemas
    - Document data model schemas
    - Validate dataset instances with schemas
    - Transform data in one model to another data model
    - Transform data in one model to another data model
    - Transform from one representation to another
    - Integrating data from two different data models

### The Problem

- In the 1960s data interaction was primitive and formal conceptualization of data as data was rare
    - Typically no clear separation between storage methods and intrinsic structure of information being represented
    - Programs are interacting directly with storage
- With no formally defined approach to data storage application development becomes much more challenging
    - Many different access subroutines must be defined
    - Often not interoperable
    - Cannot sustain 3rd part integrations
    - All tools must be modified as storage formats change
- Data independence
    1. If storage method changes then end user programs accessing the data will fail to perform as expected
    2. If new kinds of data need to be represented then again end user programs may fail

### Relational Model

- Conceptualize data as relations (tables) and then map those relations to whatever storage methods are being used
    - The relational model is a simple high-level abstraction for conceptualizing information
    - Indifferent to details of physical storage and processing
    - Operations on data are formally defined
- How it works
    - Programmers and users need know nothing about storage methods
    - Documentation will have common structure and organization
    - Data from different sources can be integrated more easily
    - Data is easier to check for validity and quality

### How is the Relational Model Implemented?

- Tuples order is insignificant for the math
- Schema - specification for how data will be organized and written in a schema language

- Functional dependency - things that have to match up in the database
- Normalization reduces redundancies that cause error and inconsistency
- Contraints
    - Help model real world
    - Support validation and consistency
- Relational model supports use of well-understood query languages

### Abstraction, Indirection, and Data Independence

- Relational representation abstracts away specific and transient details of storage and presents on intrinsic features of the data
- Subsequent interaction with the stored data is indirect via a mapping from the relational schemas to the stored data

- Physical data independence - the physical schema can change without affecting interactions of the data
- Logical schema independence - logical schema can change without affecting interactions with the data
