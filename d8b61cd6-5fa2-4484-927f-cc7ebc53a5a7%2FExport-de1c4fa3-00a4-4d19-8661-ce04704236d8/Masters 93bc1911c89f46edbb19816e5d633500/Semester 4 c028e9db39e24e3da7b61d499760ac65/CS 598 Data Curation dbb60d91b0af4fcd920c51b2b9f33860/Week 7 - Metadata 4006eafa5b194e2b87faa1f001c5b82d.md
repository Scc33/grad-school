# Week 7 - Metadata

### What is Metadata?

- Metadata - data about data
    - Metadata can be extremely varied
    - Structured data about an object that supports functions associated with the designated object
- Standards of classification of metadata
    - Descriptive
    - Administrative
    - Structural
- Can have machine and human uses
- One persons metadata is another persons data

### Metadata Schemas

- Pure metadata schemas are conceptual
    - Sometimes vocabulary independent
    - Often syntax/serialization independent

- Metadata schemas can be combined, specialized, and extended in various ways

### Common Metadata Ambiguities

- Metadata is often casually used with ambiguous semantics
    - Typically takes the form of attribute value pairs which are obvious to humans but not robots

### How does metadata support data curation?

### Quiz

    - **None of the above**
- According to lecture, a metadata schema is defined as “a set of data elements with specified meanings for supporting metadata statements in a particular context.” Which of the following is not a characteristic of metadata schemas discussed?
    - **Metadata schemas can be viewed as a conceptual model of a domain.**
- Riley (2017) provides a taxonomy of metadata types. Which of the following is not included in the taxonomy?
    - **Metadata about the quality of the resource**
- Neuman and Brase (2014) describe the DataCite initiative. Which of the following is not described by the authors?
    - **DataCite is also research data repository, providing storage and preservation services for scientific data.**
- Visengeriyeva and Abidjan (2020) present a unique perspective on metadata in the context of data quality and data cleaning. Which of the following do the authors discuss?
    - Quality information can be stored as useful metadata to better understand data.
    - Quality metadata can be acquired by profiling the original data
    - Quality metadata can be used to support data cleaning activities
    - **All of the above**
- Haley et al. (2016) describe the Google GOODS data catalog of billions of internal datasets. Which of the following types of metadata do they collect about the datasets?
    - **Basic information such as size, format, last modified time, and access control lists.**
    - **Content-based information such as the dataset's schema, key fields, and hashes/fingerprints of individual fields.**
    - **Provenance information about the dataset including how it was produced, how it is used, and whether other datasets depend on it.**
- Gebru et al. (2021) propose data sheets for datasets to facilitate communication between dataset creators and consumers. Which of the following points do the authors not make?
    - **The process of creating a datasheet is intended to be automated.**
- In general, a metadata schema (or scheme) defines a set of structured elements, along with their semantics and allowable values, to use to describe an object or resources. Which of the following is not an example of a metadata schema for the description of datasets or data catalogs?
    - **Hierarchical Data Format (HDF)**
- According to lecture, which of the following is not an example of core curatorial actives are supported by metadata?
    - **None of the above**
