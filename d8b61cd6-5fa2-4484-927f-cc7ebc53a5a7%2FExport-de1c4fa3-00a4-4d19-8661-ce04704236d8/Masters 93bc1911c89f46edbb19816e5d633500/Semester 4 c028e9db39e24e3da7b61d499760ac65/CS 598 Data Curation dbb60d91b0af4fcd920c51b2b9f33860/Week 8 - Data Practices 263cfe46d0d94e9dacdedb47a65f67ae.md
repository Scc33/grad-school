# Week 8 - Data Practices

### Data Practices

- An empirical view of what people creating, analyzing, and managing data actually do
- Data practices
    - The science of data analytics is interdisciplinary but mostly math
    - The science of data curation is interdisciplinary but mostly social science
        - Empirical research
            - Constructed studies
            - Naturalistic studies - typically collect data about an actual ongoing research situation
        - Methods
            - Data collection methods - Interviews, surveys, transaction logs, work product analysis, time and motion studies, simulations, and so on
            - Analytical methods - math, quantitative analysis, stats, information and cognitive science, etc

### What's going on in the lab?

- As a general rule researchers generally do not test or document their programs rigorously
- Lots of researchers don’t describe data with metadata
- Good practices are hard in the short term even if they benefit in the long term

### Data sharing

- Arduous and time consuming to develop data
- Why data sharing is hard
    - On receiving side there are integration difficulties
    - On share side what incentive is there to share

- Create incentives for sharing - give credit, create infrastructure, reciprocity

### Data Reuse

- Data sharing - tends to focus on why and how data producers share or don't share their data
- Data reuse - tends to focus on how communities use or don’t use relevant data they did not produce and for which they are not the intended consumer
- Data sharing focuses on the producer and data reuse focuses on the consumer
- Reuses challenges

    - Area specific challenges
        - Medical, financial, social, and government are heavily regulated and have tort or statutory liabilities for violations
        - For-profit may not want to share because of revenue or strategic value

### Quiz

- According to lecture which of the following describe the empirical science of data curation:
    - The study of what people creating, analyzing, managing, and using data actually do.
    - An interdisciplinary field of study, but primarily based on social science research methods (i.e., the study of people and behaviors).
    - Addresses questions such as how we can more efficiently and reliably support the use of data.
    - **All of the above.**
- Based on the lectures, which of the following is described as a method generally used to study data practices?
    - Constructing an experiment or targeted data collection to confirm or refute a hypothesis.
    - Observing what people are actually doing in an ongoing data-related activity and using these observations to develop theories or ideas for interventions or changes in practice.
    - **Both of the above**
- Based on lecture, which of the following can be said about data sharing?
    - **Many researchers are concerned about the misinterpretation or misuse of their data if shared.**
- According to lecture which of the following is not a factoring affecting the reuse of data?
    - **None of the above**
- Tenopir et al. (2020) report the results of a study of data sharing attitudes and practices among researchers. Which of the following is not a key finding of their study:
    - **A majority of survey respondents use what the authors refer to as "good data practices" such as storing data in discipline or institutional research data repositories.**
- In a study of the long-term availability of data associated with publications, Federer (2022) analyzes a set of “Data Availability” statements extracted from articles published in the journal PLOS ONE. Which of the following is not a key finding of their study:
    - **Resources assigned DOIs or URLs were equally likely to be available**
- Stodden, Seiler, and Ma (2018) report on a study of the effectiveness of policies on the reproducibility of computational results reported in the journal Science, which had adopted a new policy required that authors make available data and code sufficient to support reproduction of results. Which of the following is not a finding or conclusion of their study?
    - **They conclude that the journal's policy is an effective method of ensuring the reproducibility of computational research.**
- Data practices research often involves the use of qualitative research methods. Karcher et al. (2016) describe the Qualitative Data Repository (QDR), a specialized research data repository for qualitative and mixed-methods research. Which of the following is not a challenge to qualitative data sharing discussed in the paper.
    - **None of the above**
