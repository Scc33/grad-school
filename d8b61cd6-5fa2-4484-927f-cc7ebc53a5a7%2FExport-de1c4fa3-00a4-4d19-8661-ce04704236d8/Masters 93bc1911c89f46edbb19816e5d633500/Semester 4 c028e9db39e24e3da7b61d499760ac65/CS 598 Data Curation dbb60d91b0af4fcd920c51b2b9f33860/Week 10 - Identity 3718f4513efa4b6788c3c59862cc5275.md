# Week 10 - Identity

### Why is identification important?

- Identification problems
    - Archiving
    - Preservation
    - Security
    - Authentication
    - Reproducibility
    - Provenance
    - Conversions
- Identifiers
    - Enable discovery and reuse of relevant data sets
    - Support management of data sets (including version control, correction, conversion, etc)
    - Support workflow and provenance tracking
    - Promote transparency and reproducibility
    - Give credit to data producers

### What are we identifying

- Without shared identifiers we cannot reliably communicate what we are talking about

### How do we identify

- Identification works from the bottom up
- We identify the bitstream in a normal form in order to indirectly identify higher levels
- Encoding identity
    - Compare that recorded 1s and 0s are the same
    - Step up to bytes
    - Step up to corresponding integers or characters or semantic tokens
- Syntax identity
    - Establishing the two data sets contain the same representation of relations, triples, graphs, etc is much more challenging

### Identifiers and Change

- Managing data means managing change
    - But which of things in workflow actually change
- Most things in the digital world are absolutely immutable
- Changing is losing or gaining a property
- Human communication uses natural language that employ idiom, metaphor, and other rhetorical features that conceal logic

### A pratical example: XML canonicalization

- Canonicalization is a technique for determining representational identity

### Quiz

- According to lecture this week, identifiers enable which of the following?
    - Discovery and reuse of relevant datasets
    - Version control
    - Provenance tracking
    - Dataset citation
    - **All of the above**
- Assuming the RDF, JSON, and XML serializations contain the same assertions, the identifier (in this case a URL) refers to which of the following in the Basic Representation Model (BRM) levels discussed in lecture?
    - **Propositional content**
- Based the lecture on identifiers and change, which of the following identification schemes best reflects the immutability of digital objects?
    - **A file name based on the checksum or hash of the file contents**
- Based on the lectures, canonicalization is related to identification because:
    - Canonicalization is a technique for determining representational identity.
    - Canonicalization is a proxy for propositional identity.
    - Canonicalization can be used determine whether two data structures are logically equivalent.
    - **All of the above**
- Canonicalization applies only to XML
    - **False**
- Computing and storing a checksum or hash of an object's contents and using it determine whether the object has changed is an example of:
    - **Fixity**
- The Digital Preservation Handbook (Digital Preservation Coalition, 2017) discusses which of the following applications of fixity methods to detect unwanted changes:
    - Checking fixity on ingest.
    - Checking fixity of content held on preservation storage at regular intervals.
    - Checking fixity of content in response to specific activities, such as when accessed.
    - **All of the above**
- As with many formats, XML allows for documents that are logically equivalent to have different syntactic representations. The W3C Canonical XML recommendation describes a method for generating  a canonical representation that accounts for changes permitted by the XML standards. Which of the following statements is **not** true about Canonical XML?
    - **Two documents must have an identical canonical form to be equivalent**
- Which of the following is **not** a canonicalization step discussed in the W3C Canonical XML recommendation ?
    - **Remove whitespace in the document content**
- Duerr et al. (2011)  evaluate the  suitability of popular identifier systems against four use cases. For which of the following use cases did they find *low suitability* across all of the evaluated identifier systems?
    - **To be able to tell that two data instances contain the same information even in different formats**
