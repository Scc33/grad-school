### Communication issues in data curation

- More data is good but communication is in crisis
- Scientific communication is how data gets noticed
    - From the research process
    - And back into the research process

### Crisis in data-driven scientific communication

- So many articles and so much data…
    - Example… one random gene called P53 has almost 80,000 articles on it - far more than anyone can read
- Text mining instead of reading
    - “undiscovered public knowledge”

### Solution to the data crisis…

- So many articles no one can read them all

- People don’t really read articles
    - They read the abstracts, section headings, illustrations, all to get through as fast as possible without reading
    - Lets provide tools that support this scientific reading
