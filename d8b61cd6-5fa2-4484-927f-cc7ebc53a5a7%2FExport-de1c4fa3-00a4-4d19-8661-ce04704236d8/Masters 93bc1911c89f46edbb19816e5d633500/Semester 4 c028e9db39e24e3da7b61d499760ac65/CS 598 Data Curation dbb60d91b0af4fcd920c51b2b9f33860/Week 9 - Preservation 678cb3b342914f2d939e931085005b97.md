# Week 9 - Preservation

### Introduction to data preservation challenges

- Efficiently and reliability support the analysis of data and enable reuse over time
    - Despite
        - Physical deterioration
        - Decay of digital representations
        - Changes to file formats or encodings
        - Changes to schemas
        - Changes to software tools
        - Loss or separation of critical contextual information
        - Changes in practices and expectations
- Obsolescence
    - File format or hardware or media obsolescence
- Physical threats
    - Environmental, sabotage, hardware failure, human error
- Context
    - File format, data context (what do these values mean?), processing

### What is data preservation?

- Digital preservation - active management of digital content over time to ensure ongoing access
- Physical doesn’t need to be preserved
- Propositional content doesn’t need to be preserved
- Symbol structure doesn’t need to be preserved
- Data preservation is not about preserving data
    - Preserving physical objects is only part
    - Preserving propositions and symbol structures is not part of data preservation at all because they cannot decay
- Data preservation is about ensuring reliable communication with the future
    - Preservation actions are intended to ensures that other users of data…
        - Will come into possession of physical media and encodings
        - From which they will correctly recognize the originally intended propositional content
        - They will be justified in believing that this propositional content is in fact the intended propositional content

### Preservation ←→ Integration parallels

- Preservation challenges appear isomorphic to integration challenges
- Preservation should make data viable, renderable, understandable
    - Authenticatable, identificable… findable, cormorant
- Challenges of data preservation are the same as challenge of data integration across time rather than space

### Standard data preservation strategies

- **Replication** - make a lot of copies and distribute them widely
    - Storage costs are non-trivial, each act of replication can introduce errors, authenticity across copies is hard
- **Migration** - keep updating data to new formats as needed
    - More complicated than replication, can loss context, migration is usually ad hoc, does not reduce vulnerability to loss
- **Emulation** - maintain software that emulates the original processing
    - Highly expensive, highly complex, not all significant properties can be emulated, does not address problems of replication or migration
- **Normalization** - convert data sets to a standard format optimized for preservation
    - Data sets are maintained in a format with standard encodings, syntax and ontology, and full documentation at all levels

### Two data preservation standards

- OAIS - open archival information system
    - Very comprehensive but also very high level which means it is a general framework but not a specific set of rules, formats, techniques, etc

### Quiz

- According to lecture, which of the following may prevent long-term access to and reuse of data?
    - Loss of contextual metadata
    - File format or software obsolescence
    - Human error or improper handling of data
    - Environmental conditions that may damage or destroy storage media.
    - **All of the above**
- Which of the following is not a cause of obsolescence discussed in lecture?
    - **Hardware failure**
- The emulation preservation strategy is to maintain software that can be used to emulate the original processing (we can also think of virtualization and containerization methods as part of this strategy). Which of the following is a drawback of the emulation strategy?
    - **The emulation or software environment must itself be preserved.**
- According to lecture, the preservation goal of *viability* refers to which of the following?
    - **Data can be correctly read from media**
- In lecture, we learned that preservation is concerned with ensuring the reliable communication of what is being asserted. Which of the following must be preserved?
    - **Neither of the above**
- According to lecture, the ability to verify that a particular dataset is what it claims to be refers to which of the following preservation goals?
    - **Authenticatable**
- With regard to the broader concept of digital preservation (not just data), Nadal (2018) notes that preservation activities focus on two broad classes of problems: obsolescence and damage. Which of the following preservation methods does **not** address the challenge of damage?
    - **Emulation**
- Which of the following is not a preservation strategy discussed in lecture?
    - **None of the above**
- According to CCDS (2012), the OAIS defines the concept of an information package that contains content information and preservation description information (PDI). Which of the following is not an example of a PDI type?
    - **The information that is the original target of preservation**
- Schiers et al. (2016, section 4) describe services for the preservation of scientific research offered at CERN, one of the world’s largest research centers. Which of the following services are described in the paper?
    - **Storage verification services such as regular validation of file metadata (e.g., sizes, checksums).**
    - **Hardware virtualization and containerization for the preservation of software stacks.**
    - **A system for the preservation of analysis "research objects" that include, for example, information about the data, software, configuration options, and links to documentation or publications.**
