# Week 11 - Standards

## Standards and standards organizations

- Standard promote reliable efficient communication with others and with ourselves in the future
    - Standards promote validation, authentication, preservation, regulatory compliance, etc…
- Process issues
    - Development
        - Some standards simply emerge as common practice
        - Some developed by focused working committees
        - Some are developed by larger institutions (IETF, W3C)
        - Some are made by standard organizations (ISO, IETF)
        - Some are developed by governments
    - Compliance, transparency, access
        - Sometimes optional but sometimes required by organizations or governments
        - Most standards development is open to broad participation
        - Principle obstacle to participation is the time, experience needed to master material and sometimes travel expenses

## Some standard standards maneuvers

- Standards are build on standards
- Meta-standards
    - Very difficult to get people to agree on one standard instead of many
    - Instead you can standardize the standard of standards
        - Example you could create a standard of defining markup languages

## Compatibility

- Conversions can be expensive, lose information, break applications, complicate relationships
- Data set conformance
    - Might require a particular encoding, serialization of a specific grammar, metadata
- Processor conformance
    - Correctly tokenization, verify, validation, confirm required metadata, process data sets correctly
- Compatibility relationships

- P-compatabilty
    - Non-null intersection of S1 valid and S2 valid but not all S1 valid datasets are S2 valid

## Quiz

- According to lecture, standards apply to the following data curation activities **except**:
    - **None of the above**
- According to lecture, which of the following may impede the *adoption* of a standard:
    - **Perceptions of partiality**
- According to lecture, a principle obstacle to *participation* in the standardization process is:
    - **Time and experience needed to master complex material**
- According to lecture, while standards are often seen as beneficial, adopting standard may pose certain challenges. Which of the following is **not** a challenge discussed in lecture?
    - **None of the above**
- Given two versions of a data standard **S1** and **S2**, ensuring that the largest possible number of datasets remain valid under both standards when complete compatibility is not possible is referred to in lecture as:
    - **P-compatability**
- Use of data and information standards often requires the use of software libraries or toolkits that implement the standard (e.g., rdflib to process RDF data). According to lecture, ensuring that a particular tool or library supports a standard (or features of a standard) refers to:
    - **Processor conformance**
- Based on the discussion in Harcourt et al. (2019), which of the following is **not** true about the W3C?
    - **Standards work is led by a diverse group of organizations.**
- In their discussion of the standards bodies, Harcourt et al. (2019) mention which of the following as a common characteristic of all of the reviewed standards bodies?
    - **Reliance on census**
- Rumble et al. (2020) discuss levels of formality in standards development. Which of the following is **not** an example of a level of formality discussed by the authors?
    - **None of the above**
- The W3C is responsible for the following standards or standards recommendations **except**:
    - **JSON**
