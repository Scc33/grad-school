To pause execution when the program is running for debugging, you should ______________

- Set a breakpoint

Which of the following is NOT true about testing and debugging?

- Both testing and debugging require writing code

The fact that bugs that cannot be reproduced indicates the bugs no longer exist.

- False

Debugging can result in introduction of new bugs

- True

Which of the following is NOT a step in the Debugging Process ?

- Ignore the bug if its minor

Which of the following is NOT included in a Bug Report ?

- Support contact information

During the Tracking/reproducing process, the following was a description of a problem. The editor crashes every time I write more than 250 words in Arial font and font size 8. During one of the steps this was transformed to: The editor crashes every time I write more than 250 words in Arial font and font size 8 and the same problem was reproduced with font Times Roman and font sizes 8,10

- Generalization

During the Tracking/reproducing process, the following was a description of a problem. The problem occurs in Windows XP. During one of the steps this was transformed to: the problem occurs in Windows XP ONLY.

- Disambiguate

Which of the following approaches is the MOST efficient to figure out the line of failure in a very large input file ?

- Binary search

Consider the following lines of code.

- x = sum of squares of 2..i-1

### Topic: Design by Contract

### Recall

Preconditions

Postconditions

Class invariants

Loop invariants

### Notes

- Types of assertions
    - Checkpoint
    - Design by contract
        - Preconditions
        - Postconditions
        - Class invariants
- Method typically work properly only under certain conditions
    - Preconditions - assertion that must be true before a method is executed in order for it to work properly
    - Postcondition - assertion that is true after a method is executed
- Invariant is an assertion that should always be true
    - Class invariant - a precondition and postcondition of every public method in the class
    - Loop invariant - an assertion that is true before the loop, after the loop, and every time through the loop
- Write preconditions for methods; may write class invariants for a class
- Often do not write postconditions; those are typically covered by unit tests

### Topic: Assertions

### Recall

Differences in Java vs assertions in JUnit

*assert exp1: exp2;*

### Notes

- Assertions are either true or false statements about a programs execution
    - Different than assertions in testing
    - Reduce time spent for debugging because errors can be detected close to where/when they occur
- *assert* has been statement in Java since 1.4
- *assert exp1: exp2;*  If exp1 is false throw an exception and give exp2 as an argument
- Assertions can be setup to only execute during testing and debugging and be turned off in production code using JVM arguments
    - Assertions should not be a part of production code

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Assertions can be embedded in source code. The embedded assertions will throw an exception which helps with catching an error close to where it occurred.**

### Topic: Coverage-based Fault Localization

### Recall

Health status of line with aggregated coverage

Health status of line with nearest neighbor

### Notes

- Health status with aggregated coverage
    - (#p) / (#p +#f) for each line of the file where #p is the number of passing tests and #f is the number of failing tests
    - The higher the value of the health status the lower the suspicion of that line causing the bug
- Health status with nearest neighbor
    - Compares the lines executed with the most similar passing test to the failing test

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Statistical analysis can be useful for debugging.**

### Topic: Fault Localization

### Recall

Activities of fault localization

Expertise needed to conduct cause elimination

### Notes

- Fault localization - tracing, backtracking, cause elimination, coverage-based fault localization
    - Tracing - watch execution of the program, determine when it goes wrong (using print statements, stepping with debugger, logs, breakpoints, assertions)
        - Determine fault by watching execution using prints, breakpoints, assertions
    - Backtracking - determine a failure/error, find fault by backing up to ‚Äúfirst failure‚Äù
        - Find faults by following an error propagation chain
    - Cause elimination - what could cause this failure/error?
        - Need knowledge of the program and common faults made by developers

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Fault localization requires tracking, backtracking, and cause elimination in order to find and determine the cause of bugs**

### Topic: Failing-Input Simplification

### Recall

Binary search can be used to simplify finding failing input

Delta debugging

### Notes

- Inputs are often very complex so we want to simplify them in order to find bugs more easily
- Binary search finds line of failure in log_2
- Delta debugging is used to further simplify failing input after binary search doesn‚Äôt work
- Delta debugging - start with applying few and large changes to produce alternatives before applying more and smaller changes

### Topic: Tracking and Reproducing Problem

### Recall

Connecting bug discovery to debugging

### Notes

- Reproduce, isolate, generalize (this also happens when‚Ä¶), summarize, condense, disambiguate (remove ambiguities from problem description), neutralize (remove negative information)

### Topic: Problem Tracker

### Recall

Problem report

### Notes

- A problem report, aka change request, bug report, incident ticket, etc
    - Should describe the problem and provide relevant detail such as version, how to reproduce, description, date, test data, etc

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: A problem tracker keeps a record of bugs that need to be researched and fixed via debugging.**

### Topic: Debugging Overview

### Recall

Two major debugging steps

Testing vs debugging

TRAFFIC debugging process

### Notes

- Debugging has two steps
    - **Locate** the *fault*
    - **Fix** the *fault*
    - Need to retest program after debugging to make sure fault is fully fixed and no new faults are introduced during the fix
- Debugging vs testing
    - Recall: dev makes a mistake ‚Äî> fault introduced in software ‚Äî> fault goes undetected so program fails with error being difference between expected and actual outcome
    - Purpose of testing: **find failure**
    - Purpose of debugging: **locate and fix the fault**
- Track the problem, reproduce, automate, find origins, focus, isolate, correct
