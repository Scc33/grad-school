- Example: use strategy pattern to wrap sort so at run time you could decide fastest sort
    
    ![Untitled](Week%206%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Design%202%2026dc88fb74844ccfb91adb59887f915c/Untitled%201.png)
    
- Pros: easier to keep track of different behavior because extracted in different classes, variety of implementations for same behavior, eliminates conditional statements
- Cons: increased # objects, likely unused parameters, application must be aware of all the strategies in order to pick the best one
- Strategy pattern implements different algorithms by using delegation
- Enables clients to choose how to finish a task, hides implementation, can eliminate large conditional statements

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: The strategy pattern encapsulates many different algorithms that can be dynamically chosen from at runtime to execute a given task.**

### Topic: Iterator Pattern

### Recall

Intent of iterator pattern

### Notes

- Goal: hide internal structure of object but let clients access

- Composites usually have an iterator for all their components
- Iterator makes it easier to define template methods in component
- Underlying data structure exposed to iterator class
- Has methods next() and hasNext()

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Iterator pattern provides an easier implementation for looping through some underlying data structure.**

### Topic: Template Method Pattern

### Recall

Intent of template method

Template method class diagram

### Notes

- Problem - some classes have similar algorithm but little different for each class
    - Solution - define skeleton of the method as method in a super class
        
        ![Untitled](Week%206%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Design%202%2026dc88fb74844ccfb91adb59887f915c/Untitled%203.png)
        
- Template method calls abstract methods, usually created by generalizing several existing methods
- Concrete classes are highly coupled to the abstract class
- Skeleton method in abstract class should be made final

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Template pattern uses the idea of generalizing to reduce the amount of code written (think DRY - do not repeat yourself)**

### Topic: Visitor Pattern

### Recall

Intent of visitor pattern

Class diagram of visitor pattern

Centralized algorithm

Refactor interpreter pattern to visitor pattern

### Notes

- Visitor algorithm is good for centralized algorithms
    - Applied on structure with many elements with operations varying depending on elements

- Start with interpreter, make a visitor class, for each subclass make a method‚Ä¶

- If a new element is added all visitor classes are affected

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Visitor path complements the interpreter pattern.**

### Topic: Interpreter Pattern

### Recall

Intent of interpreter pattern

Applying the interpreter pattern

### Notes

- Behavioral pattern used to define grammar of a language and specify how to evaluate
    - Each rule in grammar corresponds to an expression subclass
    - Composite pattern can be used to represent syntax tree
- Interpreter pattern distributes an algorithm (set of methods) over a class hierarchy
    - Easy to add new expression or statement to language
    - Writing new interpret method requires adding method to every class
- Client creates the content for the interpreter

![Untitled](Week%206%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Design%202%2026dc88fb74844ccfb91adb59887f915c/Untitled%208.png)

- Steps to apply interpreter pattern
    - Make a subclass
    - Define a method for each subclass of expression
    - Define constructors for making expression tree
    - Build evaluate it

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Interpreter is a behavioral design pattern and is used to define grammar of a language.**

### Topic: Composite Pattern

### Recall

Intent of composite pattern

Class diagram

Design alternatives

### Notes

- Structural design patter
- Part-whole hierarchy has lots of similar classes
    - objects: simplicity, power, safety
        - simplicity - treat composite like a part
        - power - create a new kind of part by composing existing ones
        - safety - treat parts and composites uniformly
- Idea: make abstract component class
    - All composite classes declare a one-to-many ‚Äúhas a‚Äùrelationships
    - All composite and leaf classes declare an ‚Äúis a‚Äù relationship
- addChild can be called on composite object but not leaf
    
    ![Untitled](Week%206%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Design%202%2026dc88fb74844ccfb91adb59887f915c/Untitled%209.png)
    
- Component doesn‚Äôt know what it is part of, component can be in many composites, component can be accessed only through composite
- Component knows what it is part of, component can be in only one composite, component can be accessed directed

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: The composite pattern improves simplicity, power, and safety by creating an abstract component class**

### Topic: Observer Pattern

### Recall

Intent of observer pattern

Class diagram of observer pattern

Cycles of dependence

Use to remove dependencies

Consequences

### Notes

- Define a 1-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state all dependents are notified and updated automatically
- Using observer
    - Decide whether object is subject, observer, or both
    - Subjects call notify when changes state
    - Observers define update and register with subjects
        
        ![Untitled](Week%206%20-%20Object-Oriented%20Design%202%2026dc88fb74844ccfb91adb59887f915c/Untitled%2010.png)
        
- Cycles of dependence
    - If package A depends on package B, then you cannot run tests for A unless you also have B
    - If package A depends on package B, then package B should NOT depend on package A
- Observer pattern eliminates some dependencies
- Lose coupling between subject and observer, support for broadcast communication, sometimes unexpected updates

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: The observer pattern has a one-to-many dependency relationship where one object stores state and other objects listen to those state changes.**

Gang of Four

How to classify into the patterns

### Notes

- Patterns
    - Recurring arrangements of elements
    - Documenting experience (what experts do)
    - Part of vocabulary for communication
    - A good excuse to describe something
- Creational patterns, structural patterns, behavioral patterns
