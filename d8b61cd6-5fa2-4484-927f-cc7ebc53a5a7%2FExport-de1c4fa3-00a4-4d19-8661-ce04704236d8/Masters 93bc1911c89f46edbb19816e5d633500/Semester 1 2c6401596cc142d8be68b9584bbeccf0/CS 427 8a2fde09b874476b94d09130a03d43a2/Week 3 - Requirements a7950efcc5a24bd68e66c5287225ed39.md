### Topic: Use Cases

### Recall

Four kinds of use cases

Actor-goal list

Use case brief

Casual & fully dressed

Goals vs Use cases

### Notes

- Types of use cases
    
    ![Untitled](Week%203%20-%20Requirements%20a7950efcc5a24bd68e66c5287225ed39/Untitled%202.png)
    
    - Design scope: actor-goal, use case brief
    - What to build: casual use cases, fully dressed use cases
- Primary actor always has a goal, must pick the right goal, goals should be from perspective of actor
    - High level goal vs lower-level goal
- 1-6 sentence description of behavior, mentioned most significant behavior and failures, used to estimated complexity
- Casual - consists of normal paragraph
- Fully dressed - labeled sections
    
    ![Untitled](Week%203%20-%20Requirements%20a7950efcc5a24bd68e66c5287225ed39/Untitled%203.png)
    
- Casual & fully dressed used to tell dev what to build
- Actor has goal for the use case, system forms subgoals to carry out responsibility, goals can fail, use case describes a set of ways for carrying out the goal and several ways of failure

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Use cases are used to provide developers enough detail to understand what to build.**

### Topic: Use Case Requirements

### Recall

Three main parts of user case requirements

Use case vs scenario

Actors

Use case diagram

### Notes

![Untitled](Week%203%20-%20Requirements%20a7950efcc5a24bd68e66c5287225ed39/Untitled%204.png)

- Use case: system intended functionality
- Actors: surroundings interacting with the system (provide input and receive outputs)
- Use case diagrams: relationships between use cases and actors
- Scenario is a sequence of actions to show behavior
- A use case == multiple scenarios
- Actors represented in UML as stickman, not part of the system but anyone or anything that interacts with the system

![Untitled](Week%203%20-%20Requirements%20a7950efcc5a24bd68e66c5287225ed39/Untitled%205.png)

- Used to represent relationships between use cases
    - Don‚Äôt show the textual descriptions of each use can in the diagram
    - includes - X includes Y means Y is always completed when X is completed

What is requirements elicitation?

Main information to be elicited

Elicitation sources

Elicitation techniques

### Notes

- A process of discovering and adjusting stakeholder expectations
- Identify boundaries, understand context, identify stakeholders, identify stakeholder goals, collect tasks (use case scenarios), identify feasibility, identify risk
- Stakeholders, application domains (experts), existing documentations
- Traditional (surveys, questionnaires), Group elicitations (brainstorming, focus groups), Prototyping, model-driven techniques, cognitive techniques, contextual techniques

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Requirements can be sourced from stakeholders, experts, and existing documentations.**

- System-as-is - system as it is before machine built into it
    - What opportunities, what problems, what domain knowledge?
- System-to-be - system as it should be when the machine will be built and operated in it
- Why, What, and Who for requirements engineering

### Topic: Requirements Specification

### Recall

Purpose of requirement specification

State types in specifications

Natural language mood

Notations

### Notes

- Specifications are the basis of contracts, communication, and evaluation
- *Descriptive* statements - properties that hold about the system regardless of behavior (eg physical constraints)
- *Prescriptive* statements - desirable properties about the system that may or may not hold depending on behavior
- Mood
    - Shall - mandatory (ex: The engine shall shut off on landing is a mandatory requirement)
    - Should - desirable requirements
    - Will - reference to the future not under control of the specified system
- Traditional, UML, user stories, state machines, data flow diagrams, pseudocode

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Specifications are the basis of communication, a contract, and evaluation. Requirement specification can be laid out with statements or various notations that discrete describe intended functionality.**

### Topic: Requirements

### Recall

Requirements

Functional requirements

Non-functional requirements

### Notes

- Requirements are about expressions of stakeholder needs to a achieve a goal
- Incomplete requirements are a top factor for software project failures
- Functionality requirements are the basic goals that must be met (think UAT)

- Non-functional requirement examples:
    - Performance, usability, maintainability, langauge

<aside>
üìå **SUMMARY: Requirements express stakeholder needs and there are two types: functional and nonfunctional requirements. Functional requirements are about what the customer/user requires and non-functional are more engineering related.**
