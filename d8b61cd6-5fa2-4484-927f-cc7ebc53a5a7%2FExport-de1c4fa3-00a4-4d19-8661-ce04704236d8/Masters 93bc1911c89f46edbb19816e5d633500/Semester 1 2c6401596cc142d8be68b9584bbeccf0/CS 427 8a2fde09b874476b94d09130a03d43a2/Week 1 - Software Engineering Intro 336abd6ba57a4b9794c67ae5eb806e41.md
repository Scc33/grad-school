### Topic: Software Engineer

### Recall

Attributes of real world software

Traits of great engineers

### Notes

- Requirements: ambiguous, evolving
- Software: large, existing, evolving
- QA: substantial, testing, in-field feedback
- Continuously improving, updating decision making knowledge, honest, coding detail oriented

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **SUMMARY: Production software is often ambiguous and ever evolving. It requires many stakeholders including software engineers who must have a variety of skills to succeed.**

- Developers, users, customers
- Customer are not necessarily users

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **SUMMARY: Good, fast, and cheap are major goals of a software project but these objectives are usually in conflict with each other.**

### Topic: Software

### Recall

What is software?

Requirements

### Notes

- Software is malleable
- Software is complex
- Software is useful
- Size, interactiveness, requirements, reliability, security, portability, cost

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **SUMMARY: Software is ever changing, complex, and extensible with requirements that will highly vary from project to project.**

### Topic: Origins of Software Engineering

### Recall

Loose coupling

How to define software engineering?

Information hiding

### Notes

- Loose coupling of programming and computing early in the day
- Batch processing â€”> time sharing
- Didnâ€™t have qualified programmers to write for time shared machines
- Programming typically one person while software engineering typically a team
- 1968 NATO conference to address issue of defining the field and software crisis
- Software engineering typically expects programs to evolve through versions
- Design interface to hide data to make development simpler

<aside>
ðŸ“Œ **SUMMARY: Software engineering evolved from programs becoming more sophisticated, the number of participants growing, and the number of versions of code progressing. These issues complicated development and required the pioneering of a new field to discover best practices.**
