# Week 4 - HTTP Client (MP)

Week 4 is a designated work week with no other assignemnts or lecture material

### Date: September 11, 2022

### Topic: HTTP Client MP

### Notes

- Writing regular files instead of binary didnâ€™t work
- Wasnâ€™t dealing with typical c style strings for most of it I was dealing with raw memory so using strcpy was a bad idea had to use strmem to copy just the bytes
- Port for http requests is http vs actually number otherwise
